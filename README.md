# Atlas-CE-Projects

Welcome to the Atlas-CE-Projects public repository! This collection showcases all the projects and homework assignments I've completed throughout my Computer Engineering degree at Atlas Istanbul University. The materials are organized for easy navigation.

### Each project and homework folder contains:

- `Source Code`: The complete codebase for the project.
- `Documentation`: Instructions on how to set up and run the project.
- `Additional Resources`: Related materials such as reports, diagrams, and assets.

# Semester 1

The primary programming language used for this semester is `C`. So all homework assignments and projects will be developed and implemented in C.
