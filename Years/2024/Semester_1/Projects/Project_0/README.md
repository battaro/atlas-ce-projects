# Project Number 0 : Table Operation

This is my first project at the university! I made this project as an additional project without grading. The project is explained in detail in the `documents directory`; check it if you want. By the way, the project is for 2023 students.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in loops, nested loops, 2D arrays, and coloring.

## Features

- Select any step you want until you check all of them from the ``documents directory.``
- Progress Bar
- Coloring in Green, Cyan, White, Red, Yellow

## Important Notes

- The program uses various console color codes for different sections, enhancing the visual experience.
- **Color Compatibility**: The color feature works best on Windows due to specific color-handling functions.
- You may encounter issues if you try running the project with Git Bash or other terminals outside of Windows Terminal or Command Prompt.

## Algorithms Used
- For searching algorithm i used [Sum of absolute differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_absolute_differences)
- For the remaining algorithms, youâ€™ll find some explanations I wrote by hand in the ``documents directory.``

## Conclusion 
This project helped me practice loops, 2D arrays, and color handling, offering useful experience for future projects.
